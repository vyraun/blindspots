but then we didn &apos;t realize at that time that we needed a third because the neck wasn &apos;t going from the inside when the horse was running at the same time .
now we &apos;d like to introduce you to joey .
and the fingers can move their fingers to the tail , right from right to left , and from the top to the bottom hand .
top board board -- craig -- leo tong and i .
in the winter you sleep a lot . you &apos;ve experienced family life in your home .
as a global climate change is formed , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening right now , you should see what aspirations is to throw these old conditions across the pile , so that philanthropy will be open and large and rapidly , and will be connected in long sight .
now not all of these attempts to do love , work well .
i &apos;m paying the fourth and fifth category just for a minute ; it &apos;s innovation , competition and social investment .
and it may be that the most intact singularity that we &apos;re most afraid of is the clash of disasters , environmental degradation , of mass destruction , pandemics , of poverty .
i think there are some emerging , hidden tensions that are actually run between people and institutions -- these sorts of facilities that people use in their daily lives : schools , hospitals , jobs , businesses , offices , etc .
the first surgeon is a baker .
so think of those three situations that i told you about : factory , migrations , offices .
and they lived above the business of the business that they were working in .
how many have ever set up behind the wheel of a car , even though it should not have been .
one of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed multiple vehicles -- is , as we think , the first autonomous world &apos;s first autonomous world &apos;s first autonomous world &apos;s first .
it &apos;s clear that we don &apos;t just place a few electrodes on his head and we understand exactly what all the thoughts are on the track .
look at the mental load and as it distracts .
so , today , i &apos;m going to tell you about a few people who &apos;d never fled from their home home .
so the l.a. county decided a few years ago to spend 2.5 billion dollars repair urban schools .
i mean , her hometown , literally , west virginia , west virginia .
these three people all know how to run , you know , productive dollars through our local economies to satisfy existing demand , to reduce current social problems and prevent future problems .
our communities , rural and urban leaders , provide the most effective part of the infrastructure -- things like softness , energy requirements , just like the social cost of unemployment , healthcare , and the consequences of various health costs .
and the book let me rethink that theory because , i have to explain what i mean by that .
and i think in fact , in the beginning , my programs were a little bit ahead of their time .
and my question is , how did we get it so far ?
i went to visit college .
and yet , nobody &apos;s trying to put it all together that the next generation of children are african-american or asian-american parents with swelling hair and laughing hair in the world .
and by the end of it , he did a educational level that nobody had even held a consideration in his family .
among the people with down down syndrome , they found an actor , writers today , and some that live in adulthood were fully alive .
often the question we have to ask ourselves as parents , what we acknowledge in our children , and we heal them .
and finally , i think the same way that we try to execute in an online experiment , to make sure that if our child is not going to catch the extreme differences , even these stories of families that reflect these extreme differences , reflect the word that always makes you go back and say , &quot; what planet do you come from ? &quot;
and he had a very big head , which , as she said , could point to a point of view .
i come from a privileged family . i &apos;ve been very lucky .
i &apos;ve never shown the picture , and i &apos;m going to get sued .
the point is , it &apos;s going to be very intricate to program .
you want to have a separate thing like you face .
if you are in the desert , they can communicate with each other up to about two kilometers .
not something to be the envy or you want to do .
it &apos;s not about buying 100 or 1,000 , and i invite you to do that , and 10,000 would even be better .
and there are days -- i don &apos;t know how to do it -- but there are days where i can make it tangible , how much i can rely on other people in my life .
now we now have , in fact , 18,000 people on this website .
so we &apos;re building generations of generations up to us .
but remember , there is greece today .
now , if you look at the economy from these two different angles , you realize that the crisis is so difficult , the worse the crisis , the higher the stakes , every single page , to know the answer , and that the other side is just wreck everything .

and what we know is , if those people on tv , in congress , is that the end of the world , if we don &apos;t agree with each other , because that &apos;s what &apos;s going on with the dollar since it comes to the dollar .
and he said to the man , &quot; why have you stuck there on the back side that nobody ever sees ? &quot;
now , i thought that wasn &apos;t good enough .

where do you feel ?
and also , triumph , that feeling of transcendence , this feeling of transcendence , i didn &apos;t know . ah , that &apos;s something new . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you now a little bit about what is beautiful for me .
and i can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to make these non-invasively cooler .
no one gets to notice the broken lines and the changes .
but what i need to do now is , when i feel what i &apos;ve got to do , what i &apos;ve got to do is to be able to send enough of these flows in the process , early enough in the process that they &apos;re coming , not by thinking , but feeling through it .
there &apos;s a long time . i &apos;ve got two minutes , so we cannot do that .
so i think it &apos;s too simple .
we &apos;re pretty bad at doing a pretty bad job .
we need data , we don &apos;t need help .
you need to repeat the lesson 10 times the day .
that &apos;s going to be very clear about how religions are creating important emotions .
and if they want to give us a teaching , please do this over the body .
but that sense of confusion is so much about contemporary art .
the people in the modern , secular world are interested in the spiritual issues , for the needs of conscious consciousness , for higher , more empowered , more isolated farmers .
if you want to change the world , you have to form groups , collaborate .
and i say , &quot; well , yeah . &quot; and they say , &quot; so are you kind of religious ? &quot;
because when you go to 90 percent , because you &apos;ve got a similar view of all sorts of things , and you politely disagree with other people .
so he led me to places like chile -- the atacama desert in chile -- to siberia , in underground mines , in underground mines , in north america , up to antarctica and even to the south pole .

and those toilets there are literally holes in the soil , covered in a cell surface .
here we end up with the ross lie center in antarctica .
the fabric of stuff weighs two tons by itself .
anil ananthaswamy : what extremes requires
we need to address the problem first . how big is it ?
it &apos;s a rubens &apos; scale -- the size of a woodpecker with microphones , printer , spousal and murad , and the kids do their own books .
we have one . it &apos;s really cool .
but we thought , ok , if we &apos;ve got to do it , then we &apos;re in the library .
the smoking team is basically taking his books to come where we have one of these cnc sites to scan these from spare free books , which is great .
it costs about 10 dollars a piece to put a record online , if you &apos;re working in large numbers .
we are striving to the long-term things , and also things that can be fun for new films .
you get a sense of where things come from .
and you can imagine what it was going to look like .
it looked something like this in the broken condition -- not particularly beautiful .
and frankly , i &apos;ve got to start on big biases .
but fundamentally , those are really really accomplished , and lungs .
so fungi and mycelium actually base carbon dioxide and mycelium .
the mycelium , under whatever condition , produces a mushroom -- that allows with such force to disrupt asphalt .
and i &apos;m going to show you a graph .
there is a piano ring that you can read -- it &apos;s tested by random , when you google and smallpox .
so it &apos;s no longer appropriate the house to the invasion .
too much dietary growth of the genetics , and that population disappears .
we had our own nuclear weapon with coral reefs , ours .
