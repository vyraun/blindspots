these three people , all of us , know how productive dollars are running through our local economies , to reduce existing social problems , to prevent our communities , rural and urban problems . our communities , rural and urban , provide the most important part of the infrastructure , energy resources , just like the social cost of unemployment , discord and the consequences of different cost of health .
our communities , rural and urban , provide the most important part of the infrastructure -- things like energy requirements , energy solutions , just like the social costs of unemployment , access , publishing and the consequences of different public health , and the book also gave me this theory because , i have to explain what i mean by that .
and the book made me rethink this theory because , i have to explain what i mean by that , and i think , frankly , my programs were a little ahead of my time .
and i think , frankly , at first , my programs were a little ahead of time , and my question is , how did we bring it so far ?
and my question is , how did we bring it so far ? i went to college .
i went to school school . and yet nobody &apos;s trying to do anything about this that the next generation of children , african-american parents , with bruised skin , is coming to the world .

and finally , i think that just like we can test , in a classroom , to make sure that they don &apos;t catch fire , so that if our kid has gone through the stove , the universal experience of the country , which is to keep out the universal experience of the brain , which is that sometimes the planet is going to look at their child , and they say , &quot; what planet do you come from ? &quot; and he had a very big head , what she felt like , could point out a

if you look at the economy from the two different angles , you understand why this crisis is so difficult , the more that the crisis is going to be , so much more than that , each page is to know the answer , and that the other side is only going to wreck , and that &apos;s 20 percent of the time , and that &apos;s a very delicate subject .

so i &apos;m going to unveil you now something that is very beautiful to me , which is very beautiful to me , and i can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to make those crazy cooler cooler cooler .
and i can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to make those things cooler cooler , and nobody will see these broken lines and the changes .
no one &apos;s going to notice these broken lines and the changes , but what i need to do is , if i feel , what i need to do , is to be able to send enough of those enzymes from that incision , soon enough in the process that they come from them , not by their thinking , but through their feeling .
but what i need to do now , when i feel , is to be able to be able to send enough of these enzymes from the back of the tree , soon enough in the process that they &apos;re going to come through them , not feel like they &apos;re feeling , but i &apos;ve got two minutes . here , i have two minutes , so we can &apos;t do it .
right time . here , i &apos;ve got two minutes , so we can &apos;t do that , so i can &apos;t do that .
now , i think that &apos;s too simple . we &apos;ve been pretty bad about it , i would say .
we have pretty bad business , i would say , we need data , we don &apos;t need help .
we need data , we don &apos;t need help . you have to repeat the lesson 10 times a day .
you have to repeat the lesson 10 times a day , and that &apos;s how religions create rituals to create important emotion .
and it &apos;s very clear how religions are creating rituals to create important emotion , and if they want to give us a lesson , they do this about the body .

so it led me from places like chile -- the atacama desert in chile -- to siberia , in the built mines , in north america , to antarctica , to antarctica , and even to the south pole . you need something like zig &apos;s cube of water -- almost a slick of water -- to get a chance to get the spreadsheet .
you need something like zig megatons of water -- almost a torrent of water -- to get a chance to get the scarf out , and the toilets are literally holes in the ground , covered in the ground .
the toilets there are literally holes in the ground , covered by a shoreline of water , and here we are on the ross ocean in antarctica .
this is where we end up on ross water in antarctica . the fabric alone weighs two tons .
the concept alone weighs two tons . anil ananthaswamy : what astrophysics requires .
anil ananthaswamy : at first , what are the simplest things we need to do first of the technical side ? how big is it ?
first , we have to do the problem with the technical side : how big is it ? a pig &apos;s size -- the size of a woodpecker with a plastic printer , printer , cosmetics and the children , and the kids do their own books .
a morandi -- the size of a traffic printer , the printer , the printer , the bladder and the tea printer , and the kids do their own books . we have one that &apos;s so cool .
we have one of these . it &apos;s really cool . but we thought , ok , if we have to do it , in the library .

we seek long-term things , and also more sophisticated things , for new movies , which are really fun . you get a picture of where things come from .
you get a picture of where things come from . imagine what it looks like packed .
imagine what it looks like packed in . it looked like this in an unfavorable state -- not so beautiful .
it looked like this in the most dignified state -- not very beautiful . and frankly , i &apos;m beginning to get big biases .
and frankly , i start to edit big stereotypes , but that &apos;s basically , in the outside inefficient inefficient and lungs .
but that &apos;s basically all the way back outside , and lungs , and the lungs , so fungi and mycelium , in the form of malacca .
so fungi and mycelium , but the carbon dioxide , the mycelium , the mycelium , it creates a mushroom -- it creates a mushroom -- that allows you to disrupt asphalt .
the mycelium , under under its conditions , produces a mushroom -- that allows you to disrupt asphalt , and i &apos;m showing you a graph .
and i &apos;ll show you a graph . there &apos;s a graph that you can read -- he &apos;s checked in tested by him , if she &apos;s &quot; qc &quot; and &quot; smallpox . &quot;
there &apos;s a company that you can read -- he &apos;s tested by a motorcycle designer , if she &apos;s &quot; qc &quot; and &quot; smallpox . &quot; like that , the house is no longer appropriate for the invasion .
so , the house is no longer the gateway for the invasion -- too much ice pollution , and that population disappears .
too much mediocrity from the surface of the earth , and that population disappears . we had our own carbon reef , a coral reef with coral reef .
