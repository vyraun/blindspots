it &apos;s that pyramid .
by breast milk .
it contained the two , three , and hijacked by the fat of contaminants that was allowed by the throne .
it &apos;s often sewage , which is us clogged .
what do you do when you have a flash in the stream ?
stephen fonda : the trace of the eco-mindshift
they would be under my level .
but we didn &apos;t know at the time that we needed a third , because the neck was out of the inside , when the horse was supposed to run at the same time .
now we would like to introduce you to joey .
and instedd can move with his fingers the tail , from right to left , and from top to the bottom .
byte brett -- craig , leo , leo , joaquin , and i .
in winter you sleep much . you identify family life in your home .
while a global wave of innovation is happening , and this is exactly what &apos;s going on , you should see what efforts there are to jettison these old conditions over the transom , so that philanthropy will be open and large and connected , in the long term .
now , not all of these attempts to do great love , works good .
i include the fourth and fifth category just briefly ; it &apos;s innovation , competition and social investment .
it may be that the realities of the social singularity is the one that we fear most , a collision of catastrophes , of environmental destruction , of weapons of mass destruction , of pandemics , of poverty .
i think there are new , hidden tensions that actually play between people and institutions -- such institutions that are using people in their daily lives : schools , hospitals , jobs , businesses , offices , and so on .
the first gentleman is a baker .
so consider these three conditions i told you about : factory , migration , offices .
they lived above the business where they were working .
how many have gone on the wheel of a car , even though you shouldn &apos;t have been driving .
so , one of the things we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehicles -- is how we think , the first autonomous trade structures in the world .
it &apos;s clear that we don &apos;t just put some electrodes on its head and understand exactly what all his thoughts are on the track .
look at the mental load and how it steer .
so today , i &apos;m going to tell you about a few people who are never escaped from their hometown .
so a few years ago the l.a. county has decided to spend 2.5 billion dollars to repair urban schools .
i mean , your hometown is literally dedicated to west virginia , west virginia .
these three people all know how to run across our local economies , to satisfy existing needs , to deny existing social problems and prevent future problems .
our communities , rural and urban , service the most important part of infrastructure -- things like cordwood , energy needs , the same as the social cost of unemployment , hinges , calculating and the consequences of different health services .
and the book made me rethink this theory , because i have to explain what i mean by that .
and i think at the beginning , my programs were somewhat ahead of their time .
and my question is , how did we get it so far ?
i went to visit bagheads .
and yet , no one tries to set out that the next generation of children , african-american parents and asian-american parents , will come to the world .
and finally , he made it on a educational level that nobody has ever considered before .
among the syndrome , by the people who have syndrome today find actor , writers , and some that can live on their own lives .
often , the question we have to think of as parents is what we honor to our children and what we are healing with .
and finally , i think that , in the same way , we &apos;re going to try to test a lot of varnish in an origami test in order to make sure that you don &apos;t catch fire , when your child has gone through the stove , also reflect the word of the very extreme differences that reflect the universal experience of the reputation , which always ends up saying you look at your child , and you say , &quot; what planet do you come from ? &quot;
and he had a very big head , which , as she said , could point out on a microchip .
i &apos;m from a privileged family . i &apos;ve been very lucky .
i &apos;ve never shown the picture , and i &apos;m probably going to get sued .
the point is , it will be very in work .
you want a separate thing like that .
if you &apos;re in the desert , you can communicate with each other , to about two miles of reach .
it &apos;s not something you want to be the envy of or what you want to do .
it &apos;s not about buying 100 or 1,000 a thousand . i invite you to do that , and 10,000 would be better .
and there are days -- i don &apos;t know how to do this -- but there are days where i can make it tangible , how much of everything in my life rely on other people .
now we have now on this website actually 18,000 people .
we build on the innovation of generations in front of us .
but remember , there &apos;s greece there today .
if you look at the economy from these two different angles , you can see why this crisis is so difficult , the worse the crisis , the higher the stakes will become , as more as any page , to know the answer , and that the other side will only ruin everything .
that &apos;s 20 percent of the average , and that &apos;s a very complicated topic .
the sentence that you as a graduate student , a professor or a professor , as a liberal school professor says , is , &quot; i &apos;m a papercutter .
we know how it &apos;s on tv , in congress , that the end of the world is coming up by the end of the world , if we don &apos;t fully think about it , because that &apos;s the dollar , since there &apos;s the dollar .
and he said to the man , &quot; why have you been putting on the back things that nobody ever sees ? &quot;
well , i thought that wasn &apos;t good enough .
the wiring of our system , the trajectory of our system , is shorter than those pieces that have been through the ground , the cortex .
where do you feel that ?
and also triumph , that sense of transcendence , that &quot; i didn &apos;t know that . ah , that &apos;s something new . &quot;
so what i &apos;m going to do is expose you to something which is very beautiful for me .
and i can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to make these reinforced cooler .
nobody will notice these broken lines and the changes .
but what i have to do now , when i feel again , what i need to do is to be able to send enough of these enzymes from the patient , early enough in the process that they come to you , not by thinking , but feeling through it .
timed time . here , i have two minutes , so we can &apos;t do that .
so i think it &apos;s too simple .
we &apos;ve been pretty bad backwards , i would say .
we need data , no assistance .
you &apos;ve got to repeat that lesson 10 times a day .
and that &apos;s very clear how religions are creating the important emotion .
and if you want to give us a lesson , they do that over the body .
but that sense of confusion is essential in contemporary art .
the people in the modern , secular world that interest in spiritual issues , for the issues of consciousness , for the higher , high-volume , are pretty often isolated creatures .
if you want to change the world , you have to form groups , collaborate .
and then i say , &quot; yeah , &quot; and you say , &quot; so are you kind of religious ? &quot;
because you &apos;d agree 90 percent because you had a similar view on so many things , and you were polite from other minds .
so it led me to places like chile -- the atacama desert in chile -- to siberia , in underground mines , in the japanese alps , in north america , to antarctica and even the south pole .
you have to have these kinds of megatons of water that &apos;s so many megatons of water -- almost a cache of water -- to get a chance to get the neutrino .
literally holes there are literally holes in the soil , covered by a ct shell .
this is where we end up on the ross bookmobile in antarctica .
the cloth weighs two tons .
anil ananthaswamy : what is extreme astrophysics
we &apos;re going to have to do the problem by the technical side . how big is it ?
this is a newspaper monitor -- the size of a flock of cake , printer , rusts and murad , and the kids are doing their own books .
we have one . it &apos;s really cool .
but we thought , ok , if we &apos;ve got to do it , then in the library .
the exploratorium just takes his books to ucla where we have one of these cnc books to scan the free free books , which is great .
it costs about 10 dollars a piece to put a plate online if you &apos;re working in large amounts .
we aspire to long-term things , and also things worth making new movies for new movies .
you get a sense of where things come from .
think of what it really looks like .
it looked something like this in the most unequal condition -- not particularly beautiful .
and frankly , i &apos;m going to start with great stereotypes .
but essentially , these are after shifted , and lungs .
so fungi and mycelium , but carbon dioxide in the form of malacca .
the mycelium , under its circumstances , produces a mushroom that allows that to open asphalt .
and i &apos;ll show you a graph .
there &apos;s a hash video that you can read -- he &apos;s tested by contemplating the &quot; qc &quot; when you google &quot; war &quot; and &quot; smallpox . &quot;
so , the house is no longer appropriate for the invasion .
too much more exterior from the dot , and this population disappears .
we had our own guardian team , a startup reef with coral reef .
