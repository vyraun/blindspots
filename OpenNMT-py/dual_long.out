it &apos;s this pyramid . her breast milk .
by breast milk . it involved this two , three , to three-tenths of the legal flow from the epa allowed by the epa .
it contained this two , three , to three-tenths of the legal cartel allowed by the epa on the soles of it -- often it is wastewater what was clogged .
i mean , often it &apos;s sewage , what we clogged , what do you do when you take one of these disruption in the river ?
now , what do you do when you take this disruption of disruption in the river ? stephen seurat : the trace of the deep bang effect .
stephen gutman : the trace of the tail you would have under my level
they were out of my level . but we didn &apos;t see at the time that we needed a third because the neck wasn &apos;t going from the inside , if the horse was running at the same time .
but we didn &apos;t realize at that time that we needed a third , because the neck wasn &apos;t going from the inside , if the horse was going to run at the same time . now we &apos;d like to imagine joey .
and now we &apos;d like to introduce you joey , and we can see the rhythm with his fingers move the tail from right to left , from the top to the other hand .
and the fingers can move their fingers to the tail , right from right to left , from the top to the other hand . martial board -- craig -- leo , leo joaquin &apos;s and i do .
on board board -- craig -- leo szilard , and i go to sleep in the winter , and you &apos;ve experienced life life in your home .
in the winter , you &apos;re sleeping a lot . you &apos;ve experienced life in life , and while you &apos;re born in a global world , you &apos;re going to see what &apos;s going on in the world , and you &apos;re going to see what &apos;s going on , so that philanthropy is open and large and rapidly and connected , in the long run .
so while a global climate change is happening , and right now , you should see what &apos;s going on , to throw these old conditions above . so that philanthropy is going to be open and large and fast , and it &apos;s going to be very fast , in the long run . now , not all of these trials are great for love , work well .
now not all of these attempts , not all of love , work well . i &apos;m paying the fourth and fifth category just short ; it &apos;s innovation , competition and social investment .
i &apos;m keeping the fourth and fifth category just briefly ; it &apos;s innovation , competition , social investment . it may be that the most intact singularity we &apos;re most afraid of is the world of disasters , environmental degradation , of mass destruction , pandemics , of poverty .
it may be that the most intact singularity we &apos;re afraid of most of the world is the world we &apos;re most afraid of , from pandemics , from pandemics , from poverty , . i think there are new , hidden tensions that are actually using people in their daily lives : schools , hospitals , jobs , businesses , offices , etc .
i think there are some emerging , hidden tensions that are actually run between people and institutions -- these sorts of facilities that people use in their daily lives : schools , hospitals , businesses , offices , offices , the first man is a baker .
the first person is a baker , so think of those three conditions that i told you about : factory , migrations , office .
so , think about those three kinds of situations that i told you about : factory , migrations , office , and they lived above the business in which they were working .
they lived above the business , where they were working , and how many have ever been left behind the tax of a car , even though it shouldn &apos;t be .
how many have ever set up behind the driver of a car , even though it shouldn &apos;t have been the best . one of the things we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed multiple vehicles -- is how we think , the first autonomous world &apos;s first autonomous world &apos;s earnings .
so one of the things we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve designed several vehicles -- is how we think the first autonomous atomic collider in the world -- it &apos;s clear that we &apos;re not just going to put a few electrodes on its head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track .
it &apos;s clear that we don &apos;t just place a few electrodes on its head and put exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track . look at the mental workload and how he distracts it .
look at the mental workload and how it distracts you , so i &apos;m going to tell you about a few people who would never have taken away from their home home .
so today , i &apos;m going to tell you about a few people who are never pulled away from their hometown , so the l.a. county , a few years ago , the l.a. county decided to spend 2.5 billion dollars repair urban schools .
so a few years ago the l.a. county decided to spend 2.5 billion dollars fixing the city schools , and i mean , their hometown is literally south african , west virginia .
i mean , my hometown is literally west west virginia , west virginia , those three people all know how productive dollars through our local economies , to satisfy existing need for existing need to reduce existing and future problems .
these three people all know how to run dollars through our local economic systems to satisfy existing demands , to reduce existing social issues . our communities , rural and urban , govern the most effective part of the infrastructure -- things like rsi , energy requirements , just like the social cost of unemployment , hinges , and the consequences of various health benefits .
our communities , rural and urban leaders , use the tax part of the infrastructure -- things like dil , energy requirements , just like the social cost of unemployment , health care , and the consequences of various health costs , and the book let me rethink the theory , because i have to explain what i mean by that .
and the book let me rethink that theory , because , i have to explain what i mean by that , and i think in the beginning , my programs were a little ahead of their programs .
and i honestly think in the beginning , my programs were a little ahead of their time , and my question is , how did we get it so far ?
and my question is , how did we get it so far ? i was visiting it .
i went to school , and yet no one &apos;s trying to do anything about this , that the next generation of children are african-american or asian-american parents with mbusa skin and laughing hair in the world .
and yet , nobody &apos;s trying to put anything on it that the next generation of children were african-american or asian-american parents with a cushioned skin , and they came to the world , and at the end , he made it to a educational level that nobody had even held their own consideration in their family .
and by the end of it , he got it to an educational level that nobody had held even a consideration in his family , with down syndrome today , who had an actor , writers , and some that live in adulthood were fully alive .
among the people with down down syndrome , it &apos;s an actor who &apos;s actors , writers , and others who are all living on our lives , often , is the question we have to ask ourselves as parents , what we recognize in our children , and what we are accepting on them .
it &apos;s often the question that we have to ask ourselves as parents , and what we are trying to help them out on their children , to make sure that they don &apos;t catch fire , that they don &apos;t catch fire , that they can &apos;t even start to overcome these extreme differences , reflect the universal experience of the word that always always suggests that sometimes you go to the kid , and you ask yourself , &quot; what planet do you come from ? &quot;
and finally , just as we try to do a test experiment in a test system , to make sure that if our child was not going to catch these extreme differences , they could always reflect the child , reflect the same differences , reflect the child at times , and say , &quot; what planet do you come from ? &quot; and he had a very big head , which you might think might be on a micro-level .
and he had a very big head , which , as you can imagine , could point out on a whim . i come from a privileged family . i &apos;ve been very lucky .
i come from a privileged family . i &apos;ve never been lucky ; i &apos;ve never shown the image , and i &apos;m going to get sued .
i &apos;ve never shown the picture , and i &apos;m probably going to get sued . the point is to be very intricate .
the point is , it &apos;s going to be very intricate to program , and you want to be a separate thing like the vegetable reserve .
you want to get a separate thing like this , and you &apos;re going to be able to communicate in the desert , and you can communicate with each other up to about two kilometers .
you know , when you &apos;re in the desert , you can communicate with one another , up to about two miles , not something to be the envy or something you want to do .
not something to be the envy or you want to be buying . it &apos;s not a matter of buying 100 or 1,000 . i invite you to do that , and 10,000 are even better .
it &apos;s not about buying 100 or 1,000 . i invite you to make it , and 10,000 are even better . and there &apos;s days -- i don &apos;t know how to do it -- but there &apos;s days where i can feel it , how much i &apos;m dependent on other people in my life .
and there are days -- i don &apos;t know how to do it all the way -- but there are days where i can make it tangible , how much i can take for quite anything in my life , on other people , and now we have really 18,000 people on this website .
now , in fact , we have , in fact , 18,000 people on this website , we &apos;re going to build 18,000 people in generations .
we &apos;re going to build generations in front of generations , but remember , there &apos;s greece today .
but think about it , there &apos;s greece today . if you look at the economy of these two different angles , they understand why the crisis is so difficult , the more the crisis is going to be , the higher the flight , every page , to know the answer , and that the other side is just wreck .
and if you look at the economy from these two different angles , you realize that the crisis &apos;s going to be so difficult , the higher the stakes , every page , to be familiar with the answer , and that the other side is only wreck , and that &apos;s 20 percent of the time , and this is a very difficult subject .
this is 20 percent of the cover , and this is a very difficult subject , the sentence that you as a grad student , or a professor , as a professor of design , says , &quot; i &apos;m a papercutter .
the sentence that you have as a grad student , or professor professor , who says , &quot; i &apos;m a gamer , we know that if those people on television , in congress , shows that the end of the world , if we don &apos;t agree with each other , because that &apos;s what &apos;s going on with the dollar since it comes to the dollar .
and we know that when these people on tv , in congress , the end of the world , if we don &apos;t agree with the dollar , because that &apos;s what happens to the dollar . and he said to the man , &quot; why do you have that on the back of the things that nobody ever sees ? &quot;
and he said to the man , &quot; why did you soak up on the back things that nobody ever sees ? &quot; well , i thought that wasn &apos;t good enough .
well , i thought that &apos;s not good enough . bank wiring from our system to these parts is shorter than those parts , through the chunnel , with the cortex .
the retrofit of our own senses to these parts is shorter than those parts that have to be through the dna museum , through the cerebral cortex . where do you feel that ?
where are you feeling that ? and also triumph , that sense of transcendence , this feeling of transcendence , i didn &apos;t know . ah , that &apos;s something new . &quot;
and also , triumph , that feeling of transcendence , this feeling of transcendence , i didn &apos;t know . ah , this is something new . so i &apos;m going to unveil you now something that is very beautiful to me .
so i &apos;m going to show you now a little bit about what &apos;s beautiful for me , and i can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to make this sigmoidal cooler .
and i can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to make these sweet , cooler , and nobody will notice those broken lines and the changes .
no one &apos;s going to notice these broken lines and changes . but what i have to do now is , if i feel what i &apos;ve got to do , what i &apos;ve got to do is to be able to be able to send enough of these flows in the process , early enough in the process that they &apos;re coming in , not by thinking , but feeling through it .
but what i &apos;ve got to do now is , when i feel what i &apos;ve got to do , is to be able to send enough of these flows in the process , early enough in the process that they &apos;re coming through , not feeling through her , but feeling . there &apos;s two minutes , so i can &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s right . here , i &apos;ve got two minutes , so we can &apos;t do this . so i think this too simple .
so , i think that &apos;s too simple . we have pretty bad math , i would say .
we &apos;ve been pretty poor , i would say , we need data , we don &apos;t need help .
we need data , no help . you have to do the lesson 10 times a day .
you have to repeat the lesson 10 times the lesson , which is how religions are rituals in creating important emotions .
and that gets very clear about how religions are creating important emotion , and if they want to give us a lesson , they &apos;re doing that about the body .
and so if you want to give us a lesson , you &apos;ll do this over the body , but that sense of a confusion is essentially in contemporary art .
but that sense of a confusion is the amount of contemporary art , the people in the modern , secular world , who are interested in spiritual issues , for the needs of conscious consciousness , for the higher , more empowered , a very often isolated creature .
people in the modern , secular world are interested in the spiritual issues for the needs of conscious consciousness , for the needs of conscious consciousness , for the better , many isolated beings . if they want to change the world , they need to form groups , collaborative .
if you want to change the world , you have to educate groups , collaborate . and then i say , &quot; oh , you know , &quot; and they &apos;re like , &quot; so , are you sort of religious ? &quot;
and then i say , &quot; well , you know . &quot; and they say , &quot; so are you sort of religious ? &quot; because you agree to 90 percent because you have a similar view of so many things , and you politely disagree with other people .
because if you &apos;ve been 90 percent , because you have a similar view of all kinds of things , and you &apos;re ignorant to others like chile -- that &apos;s the largest desert in chile -- the atacama desert in chile -- to siberia , in underground mines , in north america , to antarctica , to antarctica and even to the south pole .
so , he led me to places like chile -- the atacama desert in chile -- in underground , in underground mines , in north america , to antarctica , and even to antarctica . you need to do something like the tens of megatons of water -- almost a water of water -- to have a chance to get with the neutrino .
you need to take something like , just like , tens of megatons of water -- almost a peak of water on water -- to have a chance to get with the neutrino , and the toilets there are literally holes in the soil , covered in a non-zero-sum structure .
and the toilets there , literally , are holes in the ground , covered in a layer of desert , and we &apos;re flying on the ross field in antarctica .
and here we end up on the ross bee company in antarctica , and this is two tons by itself .
the fabric of stuff is two tons . anil ananthaswamy : what needs extremes of astrophysics .
anil ananthaswamy : well , let &apos;s first say , how do we need to address the problem of the technical side ? how big is it ?
the first thing we need to do is to deal with the technical side . how big is it ? the size of a woodpecker with computer rings , printer , two-dimensional and puffy , and the kids do their own books .
a rubens &apos; scale -- the size of a woodpecker with puppies , printer , ignarro and necktie designers , and the kids do their own books . we have one . he &apos;s really cool .
we have one . it &apos;s really cool , but we thought , okay , if we have to do it , then we have to do it in the library .
but we thought , ok , if we &apos;ve got to do it , then in the library , and the baby magazine is just going to get his books to go to ucla where we have one of these cnc sites to scan the books of free books , which is great .
the team project is basically taking his books to come where we have one of these cnc sites to scan these from spare free books , which is great . it costs about 10 dollars a piece to put a record online when you &apos;re working in large amounts .
it costs about 10 dollars a piece to put a record online , when you &apos;re working in large numbers , and we &apos;re striving long-term things , and also , you know , more fun things , for new films , for new films .
we &apos;re striving to look at long-term things , and also more exciting things , for new movies , and you can get the idea of where things are coming from .
you get an idea of where things come from . imagine what it would look like .
and imagine what it looked like . it looked something like this in the ventral state , not very much .
it looked something like this in the ventral state , not very , very nice . and frankly , i &apos;m going to push on big biases .
and frankly , i &apos;m starting to be on big biases , but these are basically really really shifted to the outside , and lungs .
but essentially , they are really , intrinsically modified , and lungs , so fungi and mycelium , it &apos;s carbon dioxide , reduced carbon dioxide .
so fungi and mycelium put carbon dioxide in shape , the mycelium , under whatever circumstances , produced a mushroom -- that allows the force to disrupt asphalt .
the mycelium , under whatever circumstances , produces a mushroom -- that can break up asphalt to disrupt asphalt , and i &apos;ll show you a plot .
and i &apos;m going to show you a graph . there is a computer company that you can read -- it &apos;s tested by random , when you google &quot; smallpox &quot; and &quot; smallpox . &quot;
there &apos;s a piano ray that you can read -- it &apos;s tested by gps mills , when you google &quot; smallpox &quot; and &quot; smallpox &quot; and that &apos;s how the house is no longer appropriate to the invasion .
so it &apos;s no longer suited to the invasion , too much dietary space from the surface , and that population disappears .
too much of a legibility mass of debt , and this population is disappearing , we had our own cottage reef in a coral reef with coral reefs .
